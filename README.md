# php-oci8-aur
An [AUR] package build for PHP's [OCI8] extension.

## Building
You can of course build this package using [makepkg], but the recommended way
of building this package is using [Docker].  This can be done like so:

```bash
docker build --tag php-oci8-aur .
docker run --rm --volume "$(pwd):/package" php-oci8-aur
```

This will start create a docker image tagged as php-oci8-aur and build the
package inside the container.  As a result you should get the built package in
your current directory.
